# Magma Obsidian Plugin

🪄 An Obsidian plugin providing utility features for my personal knowledge management system.

## Features

### Projects & Areas ID (PARA)

This feature automatically assigns IDs to Projects and Areas based on the PARA method. The IDs are generated
incrementally, starting from 101 for Projects and 201 for Areas.

| Type     | Prefix       | Assigned ID (Example) |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Projects | `1xx-<name>` | `101-<name>`          |
| Areas    | `2xx-<name>` | `201-<name>`          |
